# testing_zone1

This repository contains miscellaneous experiments. To try the advection-diffusion example you will need `numpy` and `matplotlib` installed. A `requirements.txt` file is provided for convenience.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the example by executing `gas_transport_modelling/advection_diffusion.py` from the repository root:

```bash
python gas_transport_modelling/advection_diffusion.py
```

A window should appear displaying the final concentration field.
